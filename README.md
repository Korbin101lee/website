Hello my name is Korbin HIllan, This is my website project/portfolio to demonstrate some of my html and css learning journey as well as hopefully the backend javascript to become a full stack developer.
This project will also be used to contain a link and discription of all my projects i will make in my future for my resume and to expand my portfolio. Thank you for looking into my personal website.
