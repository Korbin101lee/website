        <p>Hello, my name is Korbin Hillan, and I'm a 20-year-old software engineering student at Arizona State University.</p>

        <p>Originally from Taft College, where I graduated with an AA in science and technology with a 3.6 GPA, I discovered my</p>
        <p>passion for programming and problem-solving. During my time at Taft College, I excelled in my mathematics courses,</p>
        <p>finding them to be my favorite classes. Proficient in C++, I have written and worked on various programs involving linked lists.</p>
        <p>And memory management. Additionally, I've explored Python, creating a Discord bot that integrates SQL for data management.</p>
        <p>My coursework at Taft College introduced me to Java, where I honed my skills in writing and debugging programs in this versatile language.</p>
        <p>As a software engineer, my goal is to contribute to collaborative projects, help others, and overcome challenges as part of a team.</p>
        <p>I aspire to be known for my problem-solving skills and make a significant impact in the field. Outside of programming,</p>
        <p>I enjoy golfing, providing a balance to my technical pursuits and adding a personal touch to my life.</p>
